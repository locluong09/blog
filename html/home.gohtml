    <p class="text-justify px-100">Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Earth and Environmental Science at New Mexico Tech. I study water movements both on the surface and underground using computational modeling, numerical and inversion methods. My main focus during my PhD program is to develop a  new/modified physics-based model to quantify bedload transport in ephemeral rivers using seismic noise generated by the movement of bedload particles. This is my personal site where I store some "random thoughts" mostly in the Vietnamese language, as well as some research ideas. If you would like to collaborate or discuss any ideas, don't hesitate to drop me an email at loc.k.luong@gmail.com!
