In this study, we derive an empirical equation to simplify the relationship between seismic power spectral density (PSD) and bedload flux based on the physics-based model. We then hypothesize that adding seismic PSD as a new predictor improves hydraulics-based equation in terms of predicting bedload flux. We then test this newly derived empirical equation that combines the PSD and excess shear stress to predict bedload flux in a sandy-gravel-bed alluvial river. Our proposed equation predicts bedload flux better than either using PSD or shear stress alone. We further validate this equation with independent flow events and demonstrate that the newly derived empirical equation could potentially improve the predictive capability of bedload flux.
