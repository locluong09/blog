Predicting bedload transport rate has been an active research over an century. Many bedload transport models have been proposed, yet we are far from a complete and effective modeling of the underlying physics of fluvial bedload transport, or having good prediction capability, particularly capturing the turbulence and stochasticity bedload transport. Recently, seismic monitoring of fluvial sediment transport has been utilized in several regions around the world to quantify bedload transport rate. Theoretical models have suggested that bedload flux can be estimated based on seismic energy within appropriate frequency bands. Here, we first applied a physics-based model of seismic noise generated by bedload transport to an ephemeral channel. We then modified this model by adding rolling and sliding mechanisms, in which we can obtain a better estimation of bedload flux. We also consider inelastic and oblique impacts of bedload particles on the riverbed. You can read the full paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024JF007761).
