We develop a control volume finite element method (CVFEM) to simulate groundwater flow, solute transport, and groundwater age in an aquifer under prograding delta or evolving grid domain. We then hypothesize that onshore saline groundwater within unconfined aquifer in delta system may have resulted from rapid propagation of shoreline during Holocence which is around 12000 years ago. Numerical solutions to groundwater age equation are obtained using triangle elements with evolving grids of the domain. Sensitivity analyses are performed using a range of model settings to extract the key parameters that control the groundwater age, and salinity concentration. Results show that groundwater ages are largely affected by two confining units in Bengal delta. These age distributions are young in recharge areas , and old near the shore lines.
